This project is based on pabutools https://pbvoting.github.io/pabutools/
We used data from pabulib https://pabulib.org

The goal of this project is to run experiments on online algorithms for participatory budgeting, we compare MES and our greedy budgeting algorithm.
In order to add some examples to test, add data on the pabulib folder

Running tests -> Use test.py and update which data you want to work with

Seeing the results -> All results are stored in two .ods files you can access it directly or use extractor.py in order to create graphics

In extractor.py, you need to change which column you are reading in the .ods file depending on the measure you want to work with
